# Display-Lab Spike: Externalized Templates

## Description

This repo is meant to demonstrate the following:
    
- We can pull pieces of the data out (templates in this case) and use them with the Display-Lab pipeline
- We can describe templates in an encapsulated, and versioned external package (a knowledge object)
- We can run the display lab pipeline on data that was assembled from external sources

## Setup

- Follow the instructions for setting up Display-Lab as detailed in the [Vert-Ramp-Affirmation](https://github.com/Display-Lab/vert-ramp-affirmation/blob/main/installation.md) repo
